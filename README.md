# [HumHub Rest Api](https://github.com/petersmithca/humhub-api) Demo App

## Description

This is a demo android app using the rest api I created at the link above.  It really just lists a directory of users and a list of posts.

## To Use

You will need to change the api_key and pathing constants in the FeedStore class, and in the User class where the avatar is built as these 
just reference a local host for development.

This code is provided as is, and no further updates will be made.
